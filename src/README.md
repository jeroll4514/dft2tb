## Files
- `find_tb.f90`: converts .HSX into tight-binding parameters.
- `hsx2hsx.f90`: calls the modules to convert a file named `HSX` in machine code into a file named `HSX_out` in human code.
- `hsx_m.f90`: this contains all of the work in reading in the machine code and turn it into human code; slightly modified from the `SIESTA` source code.
